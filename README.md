#Dev Bootcamp

This repo contains many of the projects I worked on during <a href="http://www.devbootcamp.com"><b>Dev Bootcamp</b></a>, a 12 week-intensive software engineering bootcamp.

Projects I've deployed to Heroku:

1. <a href="danielcraigslist.herokuapp.com">Daniel Craigs' List</a>, a craigslist clone built in Sinatra (week 4)
2. <a href="http://bloogerblog.herokuapp.com/">Blooger</a>, an anonymous blog site built in Sinatra (week 4)
